    title: "Let alt text follow",
    body: "The optimizer writes AI alt text for images that have none. For a dedicated pass over your whole catalog — one caption per product, applied to all of its images — use the Alt Text Generator.",

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "Are my original images kept?",
    a: "No — the optimized copy replaces the original on the product, which is what makes your storefront serve the smaller file. Shopify's own file history is the recovery path, so run the optimizer on a product you are happy to update.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why was an image skipped?",
    a: "Images that are already efficiently encoded are left alone. If re-compressing would save only a couple of kilobytes, replacing the file (and invalidating its CDN URL) is not worth a quota credit, so it is recorded as already optimal and never retried.",
  },
  {
    q: "What counts against my monthly quota?",
    a: "Only images that were actually re-encoded and replaced. Skipped and failed images are refunded automatically, so re-running the optimizer is always safe.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I keep the page closed during a run?",
    a: "An interactive run is driven by your browser, so keep the tab open until it finishes. Auto-optimize runs server-side and needs nothing open.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the quota reset?",
    a: "Yes — usage is counted per calendar month (UTC) and starts again at zero on the first of each month.",
