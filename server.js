/**
 * Production server.
 *
 * This replaces `react-router-serve` for one reason: that binary never calls
 * `app.set("trust proxy", ...)`, and this app always runs behind a reverse
 * proxy (Traefik, via Coolify).
 *
 * React Router 7.18 added a CSRF guard that runs on every mutation request:
 *
 *   throwIfPotentialCSRFAttack() rejects when
 *   new URL(origin header).origin !== new URL(request.url).origin
 *
 * and @react-router/express builds request.url from Express's `req.protocol`.
 * With trust-proxy off, `req.protocol` reports the protocol of the *connection
 * to the proxy* — plain http — while the browser sends `Origin: https://…`.
 * The two origins then differ by scheme alone, every form submission is
 * classified as cross-origin, and the server answers 400 Bad Request.
 *
 * That broke every action in the app (alt text apply/generate, the
 * auto-optimize toggle, billing cancel, the PageSpeed test, CSV export) while
 * leaving pages loading normally, because the guard only runs on mutations.
 * `/api/optimize` kept working throughout because resource routes skip the
 * guard entirely — which is what made the failure look page-specific.
 *
 * Trusting the proxy fixes the cause rather than the symptom: the app derives
 * its own URL correctly, so the origins genuinely match. The alternative —
 * adding the host to `allowedActionOrigins` — would silence the guard while
 * leaving every other consumer of request.url seeing the wrong scheme.
 *
 * Everything else here mirrors @react-router/serve's own setup (compression,
 * the same two static mounts with the same cache policy, morgan logging, and
 * SIGTERM/SIGINT handling) so switching servers changes nothing but the above.
